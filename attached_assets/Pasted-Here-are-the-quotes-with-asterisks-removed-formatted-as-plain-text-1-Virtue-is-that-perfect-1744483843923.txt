Here are the quotes with asterisks removed, formatted as plain text:  

1. "Virtue is that perfect good which is the complement of a *happy life*; the only immortal thing that belongs to mortality—it is the knowledge of good and evil. It is not the *matter*, but the *virtue*, that makes the action *good or ill*; and he that is led in triumph may be yet greater than his conqueror."  

2. "The *good-will* of the benefactor is the fountain of all benefits; and it is this alone that distinguishes a benefit from an injury. There is not any benefit so glorious in itself, but it may yet be exceedingly sweetened and improved by the *manner* of conferring it."  

3. "He was much in the right, whoever it was, that first called *anger a short madness*; for they have both of them the same symptoms. There is no surer argument of a great mind than not to be transported to anger by any accident; the clouds and the tempests are formed below, but all above is quiet and serene; which is the emblem of a brave man, that suppresses all provocations, and lives within himself, modest, humble, and composed."  

4. "The humanity and excellence of *clemency* is confessed at all hands... for it is of all dispositions the most *peaceable* and *quiet*. He that has revenge in his power, and does not use it, is the great man."  

5. "Never pronounce any man happy that depends upon fortune for his happiness; for nothing can be more preposterous than to place the good of a reasonable creature in unreasonable things. It is but a main point to take care that we propose nothing but what is hopeful and honest."  

6. "Death is the test of life, and it is that only which discovers what we are, and distinguishes betwixt ostentation and virtue. That death which we so much dread and decline, is not the determination, but the intermission of a life, which will return again."  

7. "Good counsel is the most needful service that we can do to mankind; and if we give it to *many*, it will be sure to profit *some*. He that places a man in the possession of himself does a great thing; for wisdom does not show itself so much in precept as in life; in a firmness of mind and a mastery of appetite: it teaches us to *do* as well as to *talk*: and to make our words and actions all of a color."
